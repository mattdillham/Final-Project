781896381594120194 2016-09-30 12:39:58 -0400 <HillaryClinton> National service has always been a bipartisan goal. When it's hard to find common ground, it’s important we come together where we can.
781892832520966144 2016-09-30 12:25:52 -0400 <HillaryClinton> However you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to work toward making something good happen in the world.
781892060135686146 2016-09-30 12:22:48 -0400 <HillaryClinton> This is one of the best things about Americans—we’re doers. When we see something that needs fixing, we roll up our sleeves and get to work.
781891655796453376 2016-09-30 12:21:12 -0400 <HillaryClinton> Every good thing that we’ve ever achieved has always been because people have worked together to make it happen. https://t.co/ZxAsmgX6BH
781891468206215168 2016-09-30 12:20:27 -0400 <HillaryClinton> Trump stood up at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation—one that in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America we know.
781890612069036032 2016-09-30 12:17:03 -0400 <HillaryClinton> This race comes down to two things: what kind of future we want for our kids and how we achieve it. https://t.co/nkwAOnFbJl

781873616971526144 2016-09-30 11:09:31 -0400 <HillaryClinton> Trump on equal pay: "Do as good a job" as men.  Abortion? Should be "punished."  Pregnancy? An "inconvenience."  Wives working? "Dangerous."
781873120139419649 2016-09-30 11:07:32 -0400 <HillaryClinton> We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women.
781872597969534976 2016-09-30 11:05:28 -0400 <HillaryClinton> Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.
781871605198774272 2016-09-30 11:01:31 -0400 <HillaryClinton> To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks. https://t.co/OZv8yg8vjZ https://t.co/PZWmPcORBR
781870635324694528 2016-09-30 10:57:40 -0400 <HillaryClinton> When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.
781870087032700928 2016-09-30 10:55:29 -0400 <HillaryClinton> Alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to Trump's attacks. And he has the gall to blame her—and say he "helped"?
