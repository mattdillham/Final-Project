# Final-Project

## Can social media enthusiasm provide better insight into election outcomes?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Machine Learning Construct
-----------------------------

To effectively answer our question, we should look at the delicate mix of Subjectivity and Sentiment scores
for all the tweets for both candidates.

### Unsupervised Learning
-------------------------

![]()


#### Clusters A and B
* These clusters represent tweets that are highly subjective and either very negative (Cluster A) or
very positive (Cluster B).

* A highly subjective tweet could indicate that the person has some level of bias.  These tweets may
represent hard-core supporters of either faction. In summary, these individuals are probably less open
to reason or logic with some level of egocentric behaviour. There is no denying that these clusters 
provide some meaningful insight into our study.

#### Clusters D and E
* However, this is where it gets real interesting.  Clusters D and E represent tweets that are more 
objective than subjective.  With a subjectivity range between 0.2 and 0.5, these individuals are 
probably more logical, reasonable and open to other opinions.  Maybe, these clusters could represent 
our swing voters who carefully weigh all options before making an informed decision and ultimately, more
willing to make changes for the overall good of the country and future generations.  

* If these clusters exist in our data, this could give us some indication as to which side swing voters
are leaning more towards.  And if these clusters don't exist, probably, more rational people don't have
Twitter accounts.  Or maybe, they don't voice their political opinions on social media and make their 
decision in silence.  

#### Cluster F
* The reason why I didn't choose to go with a very low subjectivity score for swing voters is because, in
most cases, tweets that have a zero subjectivity score will usually have a neutral rating (or close to zero
sentiment score).  This could possibly be in cluster F, which also tells us something.  If these clusters 
are large, then this could represent nonchalant or apathetic individuals who are not concerned one bit about
the election.  

* Also, high neutrality clusters could be a proxy for low voter turnout.  Maybe....but we will only know
until we execute our NPL/Sentiment Analysis and Unsupervised ML.
