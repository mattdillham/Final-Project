# Final-Project
For deliverable 2 I was responsible for updating the Read.me for the main branch as well as cleaning the data. I also worked on the dashboard using tabluea.

This is just a sample of what the dashboard will include, later on we will merge the trump data and compare the two different datasets. We will also have an interactive feature with the data that will highlight and make comparison easier.
