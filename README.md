# Final-Project
Can social media enthusiasm provide better insight into election outcomes?

# Extract, Transform and Load
My role throughout this project will be to extract the data scraped from twitter then to clean it into different data sets and load said sets into their respective data frames for the machine learning models.

# Segment 2 Deliverable
Completely cleaned all the datasets for Trump from Twitter. To clean the data we decided to clean the tweets from hashtags, emojis and links to organize the possible sentiment we can see from the machine learning models.
