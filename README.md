## Can social media enthusiasm provide better insight into election outcomes?

## Project Roadmap
-------------------


-----------------------
### Social Media Source
-----------------------

- Twitter
- Unable to choose multiple sources due to limited time of this project

--------
### Data
--------

- Scaraping Twitter for tweets with the names of US presidential candidates in 2008,
  2012, 2016 & 2020
  
- Unable to scrape data for an extended period eg. for 1 year or even 10 consecutive 
  days.  Process of scraping data for one day takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
  We simply do not have the hardware or time to pull that much data and store it 
  for further analysis.
  
- Instead, we opted to scrape data for three days only.
  1) 30 Days Prior to Election
  2) 15 Days Prior to Election
  3) 1 Day Prior to Election
  
- Will scrape the above data for the following Elections:
  1) 2008 => Barack Obama vs John McCain
  2) 2012 => Barack Obama vs Mitt Romney
  3) 2016 => Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton
  4) 2020 => Donald Trump vs Joe Biden
  
---------------------
### Machine Learning
--------------------

- Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to present a Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
  for each Candidate

  - May also explore some form of hypothesis testing (T-test, ANOVA, A/B Testing)
    Honestly, we are not 100% about this part but when we delve deeper into ETL
    and ML, we will have a clearer pricture of what to do.  But we can definitely
    execute a Sentiment Analysis.
